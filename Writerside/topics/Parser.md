# Parsing

The parser's job is to take the string of lexed tokens generated by the [lexer](Lexing.md) and return
a parse tree. This tree represents the structure of the code, and can be traversed by other parts of 
the compiler. The parser takes into account the grammar of the language when deciding how to build the 
tree (for example, the parser respects mathematical operator priority). 

The parser also detects syntax errors and reports them back to the compiler, which can forward them
onto the developer. If syntax errors are found by the parser, compilation will not continue.
